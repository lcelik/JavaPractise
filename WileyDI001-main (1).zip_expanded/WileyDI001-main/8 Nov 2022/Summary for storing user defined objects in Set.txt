While Creating collection for user defined types
1. if storing objects in HashSet or LinkedHashSet : override equals() and hashCode()
2. If storing objects in TreeSet : either make use of Comparable in POJO or make use of Comparator and supply comparator implementation class object in TreeSet Constructor .

Note : while Comparing objects :
if first object is greater return 1
if second object is greater return -1
if both objects are equal return 0
